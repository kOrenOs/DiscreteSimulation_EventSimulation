# DiscreteSimulation_EventSimulation

This project was one of the schoolworks for the course Discrete simulation. The main point was to create own event based simulation to simulate importing of the material to the building.

There were three configurations of used cars with their properties. Task was to choose and approve with simulation, which of configuration will be the best and effective.

There is the track from the storage to the building and back, where are cars located. Before the building and the storage are queues. Cars are waiting in these queues, when another car is in the process. On the one part of track is not allowed car overrunning.

Project is possible to run in the GUI form with SimulationGUI class. There are a lot of statistics, which tell everything about actual state of model. Some statistics are working just in the observer mode (click observer mode).

In the project are also chart GUI statistics. It is necessary to import JFreeChart library. There is also used Common Math3 library for statistics and another own created and attached libraries RandomLib (random distributions) and SimCore (simulation structure).
